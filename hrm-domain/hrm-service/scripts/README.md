admin-cli
├── profiles
| ├── identifiers
|   ├── create:       # Create a new identifier and associate a profile to it
| ├── flags
|   ├── list:         # List the profile flags for the given account

### Usage
Run admin commands like  
`npm run admin-cli`

To get more information about the scripts available  
`npm run admin-cli -- --help`

To get about a specific command  
`npm run admin-cli <command> -- --help`
where `<command>` is the command you are trying to run

Each command might have sub-commands. For example, if you want to run "list available profile flags" script  
`npm run admin-cli profile flags list`

Each command might have required parameters, which will be promted to you in case you miss them. However, is adviced to use `--help` before actually running commands.  
For example, to list client profiles for development in us-east-1 region, you can run  
`npm run admin-cli profile flags list -- -r=us-east-1 -e=development -a=<development account sid>`
