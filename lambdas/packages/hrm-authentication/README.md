# HRM authentication handler for lambda microservices

This is a package to abstract away the details of handling authentication in lambda microservices. It is currently a bit of a mess, and needs to be refactored along with the rest of the permission system improvements.

For now consider it a way to keep the authentication transformation logic in one place to make it easier to refactor later.
