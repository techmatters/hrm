/**
 * SAFE ROUTER
 * This router ensures that an endpoint is only run if any middleware has authorized it previously.
 *
 * How does it work?
 * 1) It first runs a middleware that mark the request as not authorized yet.
 * 2) Just before the endpoint is run, another middleware checks if the request has been authorized.
 *
 * How to use it?
 * It's similar to Express Router (it actually uses it internally):
 *
 * const safeRouter = SafeRouter();
 * safeRouter.get('/:id', customPermissionMiddlewares, () => {});
 * safeRouter.post('/search', customPermissionMiddlewares, () => {});
 * Integrate with Express using SafeRouter's field 'expressRouter'
 * router.use('/resource', safeRouter.expressRouter);
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * Any authorization middleware should call req.authorize()/req.unauthorize() and call next()
 * to mark the request as authorized/unauthorized.
 * DO NOT set 'req.authorized' directly.
