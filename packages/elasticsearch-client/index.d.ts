/**
 * We export our main interface that has a reduced set of methods from ./dist/index.js
 * which is generated from src/index.ts. We want to keep types close to code, so we export
 * the types from this file, and the implementation from ./dist/index.js. This allows us to
 * reduce the default external interface of the package, while still allowing us to use
 * the full interface internally and to export all types.
